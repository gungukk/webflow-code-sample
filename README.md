# webflow-code-sample

Overall, finding the resources and using the publish site API was fairly straight forward. Here are a few thoughts on the experience! 
- A quick Google Search on Webflow's API brought me to the API documentation where I could easily find the documentation for Publishing a Site. 
- The information provided on the parameters, response codes, etc was hugely helpful to get familiarized. 
- The code sample provides the developer with the building blocks to call the API correctly. This helped a ton with saving time and quickly implementing it for my specific website to publish.
