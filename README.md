# webflow-code-sample

Overall, finding the resources and using the API was fairly straight forward. Here are a few thoughts on the experience! 
- A quick Google Search on Webflow's API brought me to the API documentation where I could easily find the documentation for Publishing a Site. 
- The information provided on the parameters, response codes, etc was hugely helpful to get familiarized. 
- The code sample provides the developer with the building blocks to call the API correctly. This helped a ton with saving time and quickly implementing it for my specific website to publish. 

Some quick improvements/thoughts: 
- A more compelling and powerful introduction page to the documentation. We want developers to be excited to use our API. Similar to OneSignal's Documentation, a welcome page that clearly states the value add for developers, highlights the most important sections, and tutorials could help. 
- Highlighting tutorials and case studies: Webflow can begin to introduce case studies on what can be done with the API. We can later on encourage the developer community to add to it, fostering a vibrant community library that showcases the power of building on Webflow. 
- Although this API call is fairly straighforward, for more complicated ones, a comment section where other developers can see FAQs or interesting integrations would be a great way to engage the community and help others troubleshoot.
